# Transcription App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. OpenAI API 413 Error (File Size Limit Exceeded)
**Problem**: OpenAI API has a 25MB file size limit, but the app was trying to send 26MB+ chunks.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `OPENAI_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 25` constant
- Implemented file size validation before API calls
- Enhanced chunking logic to respect API limits
- Added method-specific chunk size calculation
- Compressed chunks to MP3 format (128k bitrate) for OpenAI API to reduce file size
- **NEW**: Binary chunking fallback when audio libraries fail

### 2. Audio Duration Detection Failures
**Problem**: librosa was failing to read MP3 files, causing duration detection errors.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Improved `get_audio_duration()` function with multiple fallback strategies:
  1. Try pydub first (more reliable for various formats) - **only if functional**
  2. Fallback to librosa with better error handling
  3. Estimate duration from file size if both fail
  4. Format-specific estimation (MP3, WAV, FLAC)
  5. Conservative fallback estimates
- Added debug logging for duration detection methods
- Better error handling for corrupted or unsupported audio files
- **NEW**: Detection of pydub functionality (checks for ffmpeg availability)

### 3. Ineffective Chunking for Large Files
**Problem**: Large files weren't being properly chunked before sending to OpenAI API.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced `create_audio_chunks()` function with method-specific optimization
- Added `get_chunk_size_for_method()` to determine optimal chunk sizes:
  - OpenAI API: 5-10 minutes depending on file size
  - Local methods: Larger chunks (up to original setting)
- Added `estimate_chunk_file_size()` to predict chunk sizes
- Implemented dynamic chunk size adjustment for OpenAI API
- Added chunk file size validation
- **NEW**: `create_simple_chunks_by_size()` - Binary chunking fallback when audio libraries fail
- **NEW**: Automatic fallback to binary chunking when pydub/librosa fail

### 4. Poor Error Handling for Failed Chunks
**Problem**: When chunks failed, the entire transcription would fail.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced `transcribe_chunk()` with retry logic
- Added exponential backoff for network errors
- Graceful handling of failed chunks with placeholder text
- Maintained timing information even for failed segments
- Better error categorization and specific handling

### 5. Missing System Dependencies (ffmpeg/ffprobe)
**Problem**: System was missing ffmpeg/ffprobe, causing pydub to fail and preventing audio chunking.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `PYDUB_FUNCTIONAL` flag to detect if pydub can actually work (requires ffmpeg)
- Enhanced dependency detection and graceful fallback
- Created `install_dependencies.sh` script for easy system dependency installation
- Added `diagnose_audio_issues.py` for comprehensive dependency checking
- Binary chunking fallback that works without any audio processing libraries

### 6. Configuration Improvements
**New Constants Added**:
```python
OPENAI_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 25  # OpenAI API limit
OPENAI_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE_SECONDS = 600  # 10 minutes recommended
PYDUB_FUNCTIONAL = True/False  # Whether pydub can actually work
```

**Updated Defaults**:
- `CHUNK_SIZE_SECONDS`: Changed from 30s to 600s (10 minutes) for better efficiency
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SECONDS`: Increased from 2s to 5s for better continuity

## Key Code Changes

### 1. Enhanced Audio Duration Detection
```python
def get_audio_duration(file_path: str) -> float:
    # Try pydub first (more reliable)
    # Fallback to librosa with error handling
    # Final fallback to file size estimation
```

### 2. Method-Specific Chunking
```python
def create_audio_chunks(file_path: str, chunk_folder: str, method: str = 'openai_api'):
    # Method-specific chunk size calculation
    # File size estimation and validation
    # Compressed output for OpenAI API
```

### 3. Improved Transcription Logic
```python
def transcribe_audio_enhanced(file_path: str, transcription_folder: str, chunks_folder: str):
    # Method-specific chunking decisions
    # Better file size and duration validation
    # Enhanced error handling
```

### 4. Retry Logic for Chunks
```python
def transcribe_chunk(chunk_info, method: str, model: str, retry_count: int = 0):
    # File size validation for OpenAI API
    # Retry logic for network errors
    # Better error categorization
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with 150MB file**: Should now properly chunk into smaller segments
2. **Test with various audio formats**: MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.
3. **Test network resilience**: Verify retry logic works
4. **Test partial failures**: Ensure app continues when some chunks fail

## Performance Improvements

1. **Larger chunks**: 10-minute chunks reduce API calls and improve efficiency
2. **Compressed format**: MP3 chunks reduce upload time and stay under size limits
3. **Parallel processing**: Multiple chunks processed simultaneously
4. **Smart chunking**: Only chunk when necessary based on file size and method

## Error Handling Improvements

1. **Graceful degradation**: Failed chunks don't stop entire transcription
2. **Detailed logging**: Better error messages and debugging information
3. **Retry mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient errors
4. **Placeholder content**: Failed segments marked clearly in output

## Usage Notes

- For files > 25MB using OpenAI API: Automatic chunking will be applied
- For files > 200MB using local methods: Chunking recommended for memory efficiency
- Failed chunks will be marked as `[TRANSCRIPTION FAILED FOR Xs SEGMENT]` in output
- All output formats (TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON) will be generated with timing preserved
- **NEW**: When ffmpeg is missing, binary chunking will be used automatically
- **NEW**: The app now works even without audio processing dependencies

## Environment Variables

You can customize the behavior with these environment variables:
- `CHUNK_SIZE_SECONDS`: Default chunk duration (default: 600)
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SECONDS`: Overlap between chunks (default: 5)
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`: Overall file size limit (default: 200)
- `TRANSCRIPTION_METHOD`: Preferred method (default: openai_api)
