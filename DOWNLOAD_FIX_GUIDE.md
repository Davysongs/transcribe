# File Download Issue Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis

The "File not found" error when downloading transcription files is caused by several potential issues:

1. **File naming mismatch**: The download route expects specific file names that may not match what's actually saved
2. **File saving failures**: Files might not be saved properly due to errors in the transcription process
3. **Path resolution issues**: The download route might be looking in the wrong directory
4. **Template variable issues**: The filename passed to the template might not match the actual saved files

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging

Added comprehensive logging and debugging to track file creation and download attempts:

```python
# In routes.py - Enhanced download route with debugging
@main_bp.route('/download-enhanced/<path:filename>/<format>')
def download_enhanced_file(filename, format):
    # Added detailed logging to track file paths and availability
    # Added fallback error messages showing available files
```

### 2. Improved File Saving Logic

Enhanced the file saving process with better error handling:

```python
# In utils.py - Enhanced file saving with error handling
def transcribe_audio(file_path: str, transcription_folder: str):
    # Added try-catch blocks around file saving operations
    # Added logging for each file creation step
    # Added verification that files are actually created
```

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

Added fallback from enhanced transcription to basic transcription if there are issues:

```python
# In routes.py - Enhanced upload with fallback
try:
    result = transcribe_audio_enhanced(...)
except Exception as transcription_error:
    # Fallback to basic transcription
    text, transcription_path, transcription_filename = transcribe_audio(...)
```

### 4. Template Safety Improvements

Added null checks to prevent template rendering errors:

```html
<!-- In enhanced_result.html - Safe template variables -->
<span class="value">{{ "%.1f"|format(result.duration or 0) }}s</span>
<span class="value">{{ "%.2f"|format(result.processing_time or 0) }}s</span>
```

## Testing and Verification

### 1. File Saving Test

Run the test script to verify file saving works:

```bash
python test_file_saving.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úì All tests passed! File saving is working correctly.
```

### 2. Debug Routes

Use the debug routes to check file availability:

- `/debug/files` - Shows all files in the transcription folder
- `/test-result` - Tests the result template with sample data

### 3. Web Interface Testing

1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
2. Upload a small audio file
3. Check the transcription results
4. Try downloading different formats

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "File not found" Error

**Cause**: The transcription process failed or files weren't saved properly.

**Solution**:
1. Check the Flask logs for transcription errors
2. Visit `/debug/files` to see what files are actually available
3. Ensure you have a valid OpenAI API key or faster-whisper is working

### Issue 2: Template Rendering Errors

**Cause**: Template variables are None or missing.

**Solution**:
1. The template now has safety checks for None values
2. Check the Flask logs for template rendering errors
3. Use `/test-result` to verify the template works

### Issue 3: Filename Mismatch

**Cause**: The filename in the download URL doesn't match the saved file.

**Solution**:
1. The download route now shows available files in error messages
2. File naming is now consistent between saving and downloading
3. Added logging to track filename transformations

## File Structure Verification

Ensure these directories exist and are writable:

```
transcribe/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcriptions/     # Main transcription files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/           # Temporary uploaded files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chunks/            # Temporary audio chunks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/             # Cached results (optional)
```

## Configuration Check

Verify your `.env` file has the correct settings:

```env
# Required for transcription
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# File size limits
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=200

# Enable enhanced features
ENABLE_TIMESTAMPS=true
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Flask logs**: Look for error messages in the terminal running the Flask app
2. **Verify file creation**: Use `/debug/files` to see what files are actually created
3. **Test with small files**: Start with small audio files to avoid timeout issues
4. **Check permissions**: Ensure the transcriptions folder is writable
5. **Verify dependencies**: Run `python test_transcription.py` to check system status

## Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly, you should see:

1. **File creation logs**: 
   ```
   INFO:app.utils:Saved JSON file: /path/to/file.json
   INFO:app.utils:Saved SRT file: /path/to/file.srt
   INFO:app.utils:Saved VTT file: /path/to/file.vtt
   ```

2. **Available download formats**: The result page should show download buttons for:
   - üìÑ Text File (.txt)
   - üìä Detailed JSON (.json) 
   - üé¨ Subtitles (.srt)
   - üåê WebVTT (.vtt)

3. **Successful downloads**: Clicking download buttons should download the files without errors

## Additional Notes

- The system now supports both enhanced transcription (with timestamps) and basic transcription (fallback)
- Files are automatically cleaned up after processing to save disk space
- The caching system helps avoid re-processing the same files
- All file operations include comprehensive error handling and logging
